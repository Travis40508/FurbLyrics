Skills demonstrated:

-MVP for an architecture consisting of a single activity, a View Pager, and multiple fragments
-RxJava 2 for async behavior
-Room Library for Local Database persistence
-Retrofit 2 for API network calls
-Dagger 2 for Dependency injection
-Butterknife for binding of views
-RecyclerView/CardView for displaying list elements

Future Improvements:
-Abstract multiple database/threading calls used in presenters into database service class that will handle all of this logic for us. Should improve readability and cleanliness of code, as well as potential functionality.
-Implement drag and drop functionality for re-ordering lists
